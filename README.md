This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Notes: 

- I created a Firebase Function to fetch data from Flickr Public API so as to get around the CORS restriction. The code is in the `functions` sub-directory
- I have used `react`, `react-dom`, `firebase` and `firebase-functions` as the dependencies
- Styling is done from scratch(although tbh there wasn't much to do)
